# NASA Spacecraft Detection

## Overview

This project is part of the NASA Spacecraft Detection Challenge, aimed at developing new methods for conducting spacecraft inspections by identifying the boundaries of target spacecraft in images. The challenge consists of two tracks: spacecraft detection and pose estimation. This project focuses on the spacecraft detection track, where the task is to draw bounding boxes around spacecraft in images.

The project includes data preprocessing, model training using YOLOv8, model evaluation, and a Streamlit web application for interactive spacecraft detection. The trained model can identify spacecraft in various images, including those with different backgrounds and potential image distortions.
